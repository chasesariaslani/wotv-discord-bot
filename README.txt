"""You will not need to run the other files. The data is already pushed to the SQL Database.
I have provided what was scraped as CSV files. In order to run this script. Two things need to happen:
1. Enter a password when prompted. (will provide it privately).
2. Invite the bot into your Discord Server.
3. I may need to provide you the token command as well if you run the program as the Discord Gremlins let me know not to do that.

To do this, click this link to add the bot to your server:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=713922388022001754&permissions=0&scope=bot

Follow the directions to add it. If for any reason it denies access, this may be due to the url
being old. You can message me to get you a new one.

In order to utilize the bot you must start your bot command with "wotv". Then you write the item of interest.

Example: wotv sterne knight of destruction (case insensitive).

IMPORTANT:
For more commands, type in "wotv help".
